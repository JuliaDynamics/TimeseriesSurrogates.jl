# Introduction
The method of surrogate data [@Theiler:1991] is a way to generate data that preserve one or more statistical or dynamical properties of a signal, but is otherwise randomized. One can thus generate synthetic time series that "look like" or behave like the original data in some manner, but are otherwise random. Surrogate time series methods have widespread use in null hypothesis testing in nonlinear dynamics, for null hypothesis testing in causal inference, for the more general case of producing synthetic data with similar statistical properties as an original signal. Originally introduced by [@Theiler:1991] to test for nonlinearity in time series, numerous surrogate methods aimed preserving different properties of the original signal have since emerged (for a review, see [@Lancaster:2018]).

TimeseriesSurrogates.jl is part of [JuliaDynamics](https://juliadynamics.github.io/JuliaDynamics/), a GitHub organization dedicated to creating high quality scientific software for studying dynamical system.

# Statement of need
Surrogate data has been used in several thousand publications so far (citation number of [@Theiler:1991] is more than 4,000) and hence the community is in clear need of such methods. Existing software packages for surrogate generation provide much fewer methods than available in the literature, and with less-than optimal performance (see Comparison section below). TimeseriesSurrogates.jl provides more than double the amount of methods given by other packages, with runtimes similar to and up to an order of magnitude faster than existing surrogate packages in other languages.

# Design of TimeseriesSurrogates.jl
TimeseriesSurrogates.jl has been designed to be as performant as possible and as simple to extend as possible.

At a first level, we offer a function
```julia
method = RandomShuffle() # can be any valid method
s = surrogate(x, method, rng)
```
which creates a surrogate `s` based on the input `x` and the given method (any of the methods mentioned in the above section). `rng` is an optional random number generation object that establishes reproducibility.

This interface is easily extendable because it uses Julia's multiple dispatch on the given `method`.
Thus, any new contribution of a new method uses the exact same interface, but introduces a new method type, e.g.
```julia
m = NewContributedMethod(args...)
s = surrogate(x, method, rng)
```

The function `surrogate` is straight-forward to use, but it does not allow maximum performance.
The reason for this is that when trying to make a second surrogate from `x` and the same method, there are many structures and computations that could be pre-initialized and/or reused for all surrogates. This is especially relevant for real-world applications where one typically makes thousands of surrogates with a given method.
To address this, we provide a second level of interface, the `surrogenerator` function.
It works as follows: first the user initializes a "surrogate generator" structure:
```julia
method = RandomShuffle()
sg = surrogenerator(x, method, rng)
```
The structure `sg` can generate surrogates of `x` on demand in the most performant manner possible for the given inputs `x, method`.
It can be used like so:
```julia
for i in 1:100
    s = sg() # generate a surrogate
    # code...
end
```

We have optimized the surrogate generators for most methods in TimeseriesSurrogates.jl to be as performant as possible, while consuming as little memory as possible. Several methods do not allocate memory at all when using the surrogate generator structure.

# Comparison

The average time to generate surrogates in TimeseriesSurrogates.jl is in the best case about an order of magnitude faster than, and in the worst case, roughly equivalent to, the MATLAB surrogate code provided by Lancaster et al. (2018)[@Lancaster:2018], though comparisons are not exact, due to differing implementations and tuning options. 
Timings for commonly used surrogate methods that are common to both libraries are shown in Figure 1. 
Because TimeseriesSurrogates.jl provides many more methods not implemented in other packages, a comprehensive comparison of runtimes is not possible, but due to our optimized surrogate generators, we expect good performance relative to future implementations in other languages.

![Figure 1: Mean time (in seconds, based on 100 realizations) to generate a single surrogate using a pre-initialized generators in TimeseriesSurrogates.jl, using default parameters, with the maximum number of iterations for the IAAFT algorithm set to 100. MATLAB timings are generated using the code provided by Lancaster et al. (2018)[@Lancaster:2018], which does not provide standardized initialization tools to speed up surrogate generation. Note: timings for the pseudoperiodic surrogates in MATLAB include embedding lag and dimension finding, which has been included in the preprocessing step in the Julia version. Scripts to reproduce Julia and MATLAB timings are available in the GitHub repo for this paper.](figs/timings.png)
