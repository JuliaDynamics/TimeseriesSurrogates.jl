# Block shuffle surrogates

Randomly shuffled surrogates are generated by dividing the original signal into 
blocks, then permuting those blocks. Block positions are randomized, and 
blocks at the end of the signal gets wrapped around to the start of the time 
series.

Thus, they keep short-term correlations within
blocks, but destroy any long-term dynamical information in the signal.

```@example
using TimeseriesSurrogates
# create a realization of a random AR(1) process
ts = NSAR2(n_steps = 300) 

# We want to divide the signal into 8 blocks.
n = 50
s = surrogate(ts, BlockShuffle(8))
surrplot(ts, s)
```
