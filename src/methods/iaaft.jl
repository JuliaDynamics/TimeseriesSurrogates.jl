    IAAFT(M = 100, tol = 1e-6, W = 75)

An iteratively adjusted amplitude-adjusted-fourier-transform surrogate[^SchreiberSchmitz1996].

IAAFT surrogate have the same linear correlation, or periodogram, and also
preserves the amplitude distribution of the original data, but are improved relative
to AAFT through iterative adjustment (which runs for a maximum of `M` steps).
During the iterative adjustment, the periodograms of the original signal and the
surrogate are coarse-grained and the powers are averaged over `W` equal-width
frequency bins. The iteration procedure ends when the relative deviation
between the periodograms is less than `tol` (or when `M` is reached).

IAAFT, just as AAFT, can be used to test the null hypothesis that the data 
come from a monotonic nonlinear transformation of a linear Gaussian process.
