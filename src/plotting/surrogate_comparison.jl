    surrocompare(x, surrogates, params; kwargs...) â†’ fig

Plot the surrogates of a timeseries `x` using the Cartesian product of:
- the algorithms in the iterable collection `surrogates` (`eltype(A) <: Surrogate`),
- a list of parameters passed to each algorithm, in `params`.

## Keyword arguments
- `color`: Colors surrogate time series.
- `linewidth`: Width of the surrogate time series.
- `kwargs...`: Propagated to `Makie.Figure`.
- `resolution`: A tuple giving the resolution of the figure.
- `transient`: Number of samples to discard from the beginning of each surrogate
